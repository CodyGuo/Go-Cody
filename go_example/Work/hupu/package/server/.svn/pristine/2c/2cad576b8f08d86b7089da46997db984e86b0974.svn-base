// Function: GetLspGuid
//
// Description:
//      This function is exported by the DLL and it returns the GUID under
//      which the LSP (hidden) entry is to be installed. Note that this export
//      is not required to write an LSP but it is here to make the installer code
//      easier since the LSP DLL and the installer at least need to know the GUID
//      of the hidden dummy entry of the LSP. Using this export allows the installer
//      to query each LSP instance of its GUID so that it may install it.
